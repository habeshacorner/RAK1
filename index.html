<!-- FYI-> incase you didn't know: "King Haile Selassie I" speech that was delivered on October 4, 1963 which inspired Bob Marley's song, WAR! 
    "Until the philosophy which holds one race superior and another inferior is finally and permanently discredited and abandoned, everywhere is war 
    and until there are no longer first-class and second-class citizens of any nation, until the color of a man's skin is of no more significance than 
    the color of his eyes. And until the basic human rights are equally guaranteed to all without regard to race, there is war." -->
